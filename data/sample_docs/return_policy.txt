RETURN & REFUND POLICY
TechStyle Electronics

Last Updated: January 2025

OVERVIEW
At TechStyle Electronics, we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you're not happy with your order, we offer a comprehensive return and refund policy to make things right.

RETURN WINDOW
You have 30 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return for most items. The item must be in its original condition, unused, and in the original packaging with all accessories, manuals, and documentation included.

For electronics such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones, the return window is 14 days due to manufacturer restrictions. Please ensure the device is factory reset and all personal data is removed before returning.

Clearance items, open-box products, and items marked as "final sale" are not eligible for return unless they arrive damaged or defective.

REFUND PROCESS
Once we receive your returned item, our quality team will inspect it within 3-5 business days. If the return is approved, we'll process your refund to the original payment method.

Refunds typically appear in your account within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank or credit card company's processing time. Please note that original shipping costs are non-refundable, and you are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item was damaged or defective.

EXCHANGES
We do not offer direct exchanges. If you need a different size, color, or model, please return the original item for a refund and place a new order on our website. This ensures the fastest processing time.

If you received a defective or damaged item, please contact our support team immediately at support@techstyle.com or call 1-800-TECH-STYLE. We'll arrange a free return shipping label and send a replacement right away.

DAMAGED OR DEFECTIVE ITEMS
If your item arrives damaged or defective, you must report it within 48 hours of delivery. Please include photos of the damage and keep all original packaging. We'll provide a prepaid return label and either send a replacement or process a full refund, including shipping costs.

For items that develop defects after the return window but within the manufacturer's warranty period, please refer to the warranty documentation included with your product. We can assist in facilitating warranty claims with the manufacturer.

EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES
Gift cards and downloadable software cannot be returned once purchased. Personalized or customized items are also non-returnable unless they arrive damaged or defective.

International returns may take longer to process and may be subject to customs fees or import taxes, which are the customer's responsibility.

During peak holiday seasons (November-December), return windows are automatically extended to 60 days to give you more time to make returns after the holidays.
