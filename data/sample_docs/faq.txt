TechStyle Electronics

GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q: What forms of payment do you accept?
A: We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and TechStyle gift cards. We do not accept personal checks, money orders, or cryptocurrency at this time.

Q: Do you offer price matching?
A: Yes! If you find an identical item for a lower price at a major online retailer within 14 days of your purchase, we'll refund the difference plus an additional 10% of the difference. Contact our support team with proof of the lower price (screenshot or link). Price matching does not apply to clearance items, open-box products, or third-party marketplace sellers.

Q: Can I cancel my order after placing it?
A: Yes, you can cancel your order within 1 hour of placing it by logging into your account and clicking "Cancel Order." After 1 hour, orders enter our processing queue and cannot be cancelled. However, you can still return the item once received following our standard return policy.

Q: Do you have physical stores?
A: TechStyle Electronics is an online-only retailer, which allows us to offer lower prices and a wider selection. We do not have physical retail locations. However, we partner with authorized service centers nationwide for warranty repairs and technical support.

ACCOUNT & ORDERS

Q: Do I need to create an account to place an order?
A: No, you can checkout as a guest. However, creating an account allows you to track orders, save addresses, store payment methods securely, access exclusive member deals, and view your order history for easy returns and reorders.

Q: How do I reset my password?
A: Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and enter your email address. You'll receive a password reset link within a few minutes. If you don't see the email, check your spam folder. Reset links expire after 24 hours for security.

Q: Can I modify my order after placing it?
A: Unfortunately, orders cannot be modified after the 1-hour cancellation window. This includes changing items, quantities, colors, or shipping addresses. You can cancel and reorder (if within 1 hour) or return items after delivery for a refund and place a new order.

Q: How can I track my order?
A: Once your order ships, you'll receive a tracking number via email. You can also view tracking information by logging into your account and clicking on "Order History." Tracking updates may take 12-24 hours to appear after shipment.

PRODUCTS & AVAILABILITY

Q: Are your products new or refurbished?
A: All items are brand new unless specifically marked as "Open Box" or "Refurbished." Refurbished items have been professionally restored, tested, and come with a 90-day warranty. Open-box items are customer returns that have been inspected and verified to be in like-new condition.

Q: What is your warranty policy?
A: All new products come with the manufacturer's standard warranty (typically 1 year for electronics). Extended warranty options are available at checkout for most items. Refurbished items include a 90-day TechStyle warranty. Warranty details are included in your product packaging.

Q: When will out-of-stock items be available?
A: Restocking dates vary by product. You can sign up for email notifications on any product page by clicking "Notify Me When Available." We'll email you as soon as the item is back in stock. For specific restock questions, contact our product team at products@techstyle.com.

Q: Do you offer student or military discounts?
A: Yes! Students and active military members receive 10% off their entire purchase. Verify your status through our partner verification service at checkout. The discount code will be emailed to you immediately after verification and can be used for 12 months.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

Q: What if my product stops working?
A: First, refer to the troubleshooting guide in your product manual or on the product page. If that doesn't resolve the issue, contact our technical support team at techsupport@techstyle.com or call 1-800-TECH-HELP. We're available Monday-Friday 8 AM - 10 PM EST, Saturday-Sunday 9 AM - 6 PM EST.

Q: Do you offer product setup assistance?
A: Yes! All customers receive free basic setup support via phone, email, or live chat. For complex installations (home theater systems, networking equipment, etc.), we offer premium setup services starting at $49.99. Our tech team can guide you through setup remotely or arrange an in-home visit.

Q: Where can I find product manuals?
A: Product manuals are included in the box with your item. Digital versions are also available on each product's page under the "Support" tab. If you can't find your manual, email support@techstyle.com with your order number and product name.

SECURITY & PRIVACY

Q: Is my payment information secure?
A: Absolutely. We use industry-standard 256-bit SSL encryption for all transactions. Payment information is processed through PCI-compliant payment gateways and is never stored on our servers. We use tokenization, which means your actual card number is never visible to our staff.

Q: How do you use my personal information?
A: We collect information only to process orders, improve your shopping experience, and send occasional promotional emails (which you can opt out of anytime). We never sell your information to third parties. Read our full Privacy Policy at techstyle.com/privacy for details.

Q: Can I opt out of marketing emails?
A: Yes, you can unsubscribe from promotional emails at any time by clicking "Unsubscribe" at the bottom of any marketing email or by updating your preferences in your account settings. You'll still receive transactional emails (order confirmations, shipping updates, etc.) necessary for your purchases.

RETURNS & EXCHANGES

Q: What is your return policy?
A: Most items can be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund (14 days for electronics). Items must be in original condition with all packaging and accessories. Original shipping costs are non-refundable unless the item is defective. See our full Return Policy at techstyle.com/returns.

Q: How long do refunds take?
A: Once we receive your return, it takes 3-5 business days to inspect and approve it. Refunds are then processed to your original payment method and typically appear within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank's processing time.

Q: What if I received the wrong item?
A: We apologize for any shipping errors! Contact us immediately at support@techstyle.com with your order number and photos of the incorrect item. We'll send the correct item with free expedited shipping and provide a prepaid return label for the wrong item.
