TRACKING YOUR ORDER

Once your order ships, you'll receive a confirmation email with your tracking number. You can track your package through:
- Your TechStyle account dashboard
- The carrier's website (UPS, FedEx, or USPS)
- Our order tracking page at techstyle.com/track

Tracking information is typically updated within 24 hours of shipment.

SHIPPING RESTRICTIONS

We cannot ship to PO boxes for expedited or express delivery (standard shipping only). Some large items like TVs over 55 inches or furniture may require freight shipping, which has different rates and delivery times.

We do not ship to freight forwarding addresses or package forwarding services. All shipments must go directly to the customer's billing or verified shipping address.

ADDRESS CHANGES

If you need to change your shipping address, please contact us immediately at support@techstyle.com. We can update the address if your order hasn't been processed yet. Once the order has shipped, we cannot change the delivery address - you'll need to work with the carrier to request address corrections.

DELIVERY ISSUES

If your package shows as delivered but you haven't received it:
1. Check with neighbors or household members
2. Look around your delivery location (porches, garages, side doors)
3. Wait 24 hours - sometimes carriers mark packages as delivered before actual delivery
4. Contact the shipping carrier using your tracking number
5. If still not located after 48 hours, contact our support team

If your package is lost or stolen, please file a report with your local police department and contact us within 7 days of the expected delivery date. We'll work with the carrier to investigate and file a claim.

DAMAGED PACKAGES

If your package arrives damaged, do not open it. Take photos of the exterior damage and contact us immediately at support@techstyle.com. We'll arrange for the carrier to pick up the damaged package and send a replacement right away.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING

During peak holiday seasons (Thanksgiving through New Year's), shipping times may be extended by 1-3 business days due to high carrier volume. We recommend ordering early to ensure delivery by your desired date.
